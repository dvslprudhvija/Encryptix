					'Margaret Elaine Hamilton' is an American computer scientist.
					She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight
					software for NASA's Apollo program. She later founded two software companies—Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton
					Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
					<br>She invented, or at the very least, popularised the term <b>“software engineering”</b>.<br>

					<i>
						During the early days of Apollo, software was not taken as seriously as other engineering disciplines. Though in fact we had a complex system of systems, we weren’t getting credit for what was a legitimate field. It was out of desperation I came up with the term, to say:
						“Hey, we’re engineering too.” It was an ongoing joke for a long time. Then one day in a meeting, one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone that he agreed with me. The process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. It was a memorable moment.

			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<h3 class="font"><u>Personal life and Education</u></h3>

				<li>
					Margaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana to Kenneth
					Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield.Hamilton has a sister Kathryn.She earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958. She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor.
					She says her poet father and headmaster grandfather inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies.
				</li>
				<li>She met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton,while attending college. They were married on June 15, 1958, the summer after she graduated from Earlham.they had a daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959.<br>They divorced in 1967 and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years later.</li>
				<br>
				<h3 class="font"><u>Career</u></h3>

				<li>
					In mid-1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at MIT.
					She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC, Her work contributed to Lorenz's publications on chaos theory.
				</li>
				<li>
					From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft.
					She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Apollo Guidance Computer and MIT Instrumentation Laboratory :</b> Hamilton learned of the Apollo project in 1965 and wanted to get involved due to it being "very exciting" as a Moon program.She joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed the Apollo Guidance Computer for the Apollo lunar exploration program. Hamilton was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project at MIT and the first female programmer in the project,
					and later became Director of the Software Engineering Division. She was responsible for the team writing and testing all on board in flight software for the Apollo spacecraft's Command and Lunar Module and for the subsequent Skylab space station. Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software. This included error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays), which Hamilton designed and developed.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Apollo 11 Landing : </b>In one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, During Apollo 11's moon landing, several computer alarms were triggered three minutes before touchdown. Buzz Aldrin's request for additional data overloaded the Apollo Guidance Computer, which was already handling seven tasks. The overload caused "executive overflows," meaning the computer couldn't complete all tasks in real time.

					Margaret Hamilton had anticipated such scenarios and implemented a "priority display" system that alerted astronauts with critical alarms, allowing the computer to prioritize essential tasks for landing. Despite the alarms caused by an active rendezvous radar, the flight software's recovery techniques managed the situation. NASA engineer Jack Garman recognized the error codes and gave the "go" signal to proceed. Hamilton's software design was crucial in averting a mission abort and ensuring a successful landing.
				</li>
				<li><b>Businesses : </b>In 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software (HOS)o further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT working on the Apollo program.</li>
				<li>In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of development before the fact for systems design and software development.</li>

				<h3 class="font"><u>Tributes</u></h3>

				<li>In 2003, NASA honored her achivements with the largest financial award they'd ever given to an individual.</li>
				<li>In 2016, In 2016, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama, for changing the way we think about technology.</li>
				<li>In 2017, a "Women of NASA" LEGO set went on sale featuring minifigures of Hamilton, Mae Jemison, Sally Ride, and Nancy Grace Roman. The set was initially proposed by Maia Weinstock as a tribute to the women's contributious to NASA history, and Hamilton's section of the set features a recreation of her famous 1969 photo posing with a stack of her software listings.</li>

			<h2 class="font">What inspires me about Her:</h2>
			<p>
				She always been a spark for the young women, who want to walk in her foot steps. Making the men envious by achiving high end goals and
				being the only women in her team.<br />Margaret Hamilton is a pioneering figure whose legacy in the field of software engineering continues to inspire countless individuals around the world. As the lead software engineer for NASA’s Apollo space program, her contributions were nothing short of revolutionary. At a time when software development was in its infancy, Hamilton's work played a critical role in ensuring the success of the Apollo 11 mission, which landed the first humans on the Moon.

				What makes Margaret Hamilton truly inspiring is not just her technical brilliance but also her unwavering determination and visionary foresight. In an era when computer science was dominated by men, she carved out a space for herself through sheer talent and perseverance. She was a trailblazer, coining the term "software engineering" to elevate the discipline to the same level of importance and rigor as other fields of engineering. Her meticulous attention to detail and innovative thinking helped develop error-checking systems that prevented the Apollo missions from failing, even under unforeseen circumstances.

				One of the most remarkable stories from her career is during the Apollo 11 mission, when the onboard computer began to overload just minutes before the lunar landing. The software Hamilton and her team had developed was robust enough to prioritize essential tasks, allowing the mission to proceed and ultimately succeed. This moment of triumph underscores her ability to foresee potential issues and design solutions that were resilient and reliable under extreme conditions.

				Margaret Hamilton's story is a testament to the power of curiosity, courage, and dedication. She faced numerous challenges and biases but remained steadfast in her pursuit of excellence. Her work not only contributed to one of humanity's greatest achievements but also laid the foundation for modern software engineering practices.

				Hamilton's journey reminds us that with passion and persistence, we can break barriers and achieve the extraordinary. She is a beacon of inspiration for anyone who dreams of making a difference in the world, proving that with ingenuity and determination, we can reach for the stars—both literally and figuratively.<br />
				<i>With her amazing technical brilliance and hard working nature, she always inspires me to always work on yourself no matter what - even if your alone in the path, just belive in you and your skills.</i>
